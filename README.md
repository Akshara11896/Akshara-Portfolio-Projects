## ðŸ”® Generative AI in these projects
I integrate GenAI to:
- Translate dashboard trends into **concise executive summaries**.
- Provide a **chatbot-style query** interface for non-technical stakeholders.
- Auto-generate **personalised customer communications** (e.g., churn-retention emails).


These features are prototype-level and clearly labelled as such in each project folder.
