# CX KPI Analysis â€” Case Study


## Business problem
Interpret customer service KPIs (CSAT, handle time, quality) to identify pain points and propose operational changes that reduce repeat contacts and improve customer satisfaction.


## Tools
Power BI, Excel (or CSV), Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.


## Approach
1. Sanitise and prepare the KPI dataset (create a synthetic sample for public repo).
2. Build visualisations tracking CSAT, average handle time, repeat contact rate.
3. Use simple segment analysis (by product, region, agent team) to find hotspots.
4. Document insights and suggested actions.


## Key findings (example)
- Higher repeat contact rates seen for product X during month Y.
- Calls routed through team A had longer handle times but higher quality scores.


## How to run
1. Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab.
2. Load `sample_data.csv`.
3. Explore the visual outputs or open the exported screenshots.
